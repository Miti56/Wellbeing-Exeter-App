Here is the permission that an admin can have to create a category. A category can be a subject, or a society, 
but it is a section where a member of staff can award points (ex: ca computer science teacher will be able 
to award points using the 'com' category). A category is composed of a:
	-category name
	-category code.
the category code will be appended to the front of each code give in that category. this will help us log
 the origin of codes, but also establish leaderboards and forums for each category:
	-the forum will be a place of people of the same category to communicate
	-the leaderboards will show who are the top poin earners in each categories.
	 This will incentivise students to participat in the societies they have joined and course material.


There are screenshots of the working category creaion menu in this directory. this part is implemented
 on the website but not linked to it. (there is no logical path to get to it.)
